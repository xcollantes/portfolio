![]()

Developed an automated trading notification system that monitors market
conditions and sends real-time alerts for trading opportunities. The system is
containerized and deployed on a lightweight K3S Kubernetes cluster for
scalability and reliability.

## Why

## People First

## Key Features

- **Real-time Market Monitoring**: Continuous tracking of market data and
  trading signals
- **Automated Notifications**: Smart alerts based on customizable trading criteria
- **Portfolio Tracking**: Monitor positions and performance metrics
- **K3S Deployment**: Lightweight Kubernetes deployment for efficient resource usage
- **Scalable Architecture**: Containerized microservices for easy scaling

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Python trading algorithms and notification services
- **Container Orchestration**: K3S (lightweight Kubernetes)
- **Deployment**: Docker containers with Kubernetes manifests
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and performance metrics
- **Notifications**: Multiple delivery channels (email, webhook, mobile)

## Architecture

The system runs as a distributed application on K3S with separate services for:

- Market data ingestion
- Signal processing and analysis
- Notification delivery
- Portfolio management
- Health monitoring and logging

## Deployment Benefits

Using K3S provides several advantages:

- **Lightweight**: Minimal resource overhead compared to full Kubernetes
- **Easy Management**: Simple installation and maintenance
- **Production Ready**: Suitable for edge computing and IoT deployments
- **Cost Effective**: Runs efficiently on modest hardware resources

## Future Improvements

- Add more trading algorithms
- Add more notification channels
- Add more portfolio management features
- Add more health monitoring and logging
- Add more deployment benefits
- Add more deployment benefits

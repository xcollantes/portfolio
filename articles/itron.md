Liberty Lake, WA in 2016, I had the opportunity to be an intern at Itron, Inc.,
a technology company for utility meters, smart meters, and data management of
utilities.

## Impact

As an intern, I was surprised by the daunting task given to me which was to come
up with an end-to-end solution for the aging data pipeline for the Finance and
Sales departments.

In the pipeline at the time, 250 reports were generated everyday accounting for
$500 million in finance.

## Challenges

In the span of three months, I had to learn quickly. From the tools used and the
people I should know who can help with the project.

## Lessons learned

### Prepare to work independently with others

Mentorship for the role was available and my co-workers were happy to help in my
project. But given the unique nature of my project, I needed to make
relationships with different types of roles since each person had a slice view
into my project; e.g. a Software Engineer could advise with the programming of
the infrastructure, a Finance Director could counsel on what format reports
looked like, or an Accountant give guidance on how data was used in their
department.

### Organize

A useful habit was writing everything down. As time went on and direction of the
solution changed, having some kind of notes, schematics, or diagrams of past
ideas gave a historical timeline of what worked and what didn't work.

When gathering requirements from the sample of 230 salespeople who depended on
the data pipeline, organizing feedback, feature requests, and notes didn't just
help, it was critical to the success of the project.

### Include stakeholders early

Another lesson I learned was to identify and include the stakeholders early. It
took some time to find the owners of the data sources needed to make the
solution happen.

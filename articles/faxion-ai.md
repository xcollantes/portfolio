###### Trial and error with various AI models.

As Co-founder and Head of Engineering at Faxion AI, I spearheaded the complete
technical vision and implementation of this cutting-edge fashion tech startup. I
designed the entire AI architecture, bringing together advanced
Stable Diffusion models and Large Language Models to create a platform that's
positioned to disrupt the $3 trillion global fashion industry. My leadership was
instrumental in transforming an ambitious concept into a functional product
ready for market.

Our product has rapidly progressed to beta testing stage and is available at
[faxion.ai](https://faxion.ai). The platform has already attracted hundreds of
early users, with engagement metrics exceeding initial projections by 40%.

My engineering leadership has been key to securing acceptance into two
prestigious programs: the [Beta University
Program](https://www.betauniversity.org/pre-accelerator), a selective
pre-accelerator for promising startups, and the highly competitive [Nvidia
Inception Program](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/startups), which provides access
to cutting-edge GPU technology and industry connections. These achievements have
positioned us alongside other AI startups that have gone on to raise millions in
venture funding, including several [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com)
alumni.

Through my feature planning and infrastructure support for my Co-founder, we
have established critical partnerships with industry leaders and potential
investors, significantly accelerating our path to market. Based on our current
trajectory and the benchmarks I've helped the company achieve, we're on track
for introductions to Venture Capitalists with potential for substantial
investment.

### Strategic Leadership & Cost Transformation

Initially engaged as technical consultant, I quickly demonstrated such
value that I was brought on as Co-founder. When I joined, I discovered that the
team's original infrastructure design would have cost approximately $10,000 per
month in cloud expenses, a prohibitive burn rate for an early-stage startup.

Taking complete ownership of the technical strategy, I redesigned the entire
architecture from the ground up. Through innovative approaches to resource
allocation, intelligent service design, and optimized AI model deployment, I
personally drove an 80% reduction in projected monthly expenses. This single
contribution extended the company's runway by years and has been cited by our
advisors as a critical factor in our viability for seed funding.

### Technical Innovation & Leadership

Under my technical direction, I've delivered:

- A fully scalable AI generative image workflow using Stable Diffusion and Flux
  technologies, with my custom implementation through ComfyUI and n8n automation
  platforms increasing image quality scores by 35% over baseline models
- A resilient architecture personally designed to support 500+ concurrent users
- A collaborative development ecosystem where I work with our
  iOS specialist, ensuring seamless integration across all platforms
- A forward-looking adoption strategy to test and implement sometimes days after
  a new model or technology is released

### Business Impact

My technical leadership and architecture decisions have positioned Faxion AI for
success by:

- Enabling a go-to-market timeline 4 months ahead of initial projections
- Creating a competitive advantage through AI capabilities that outperform
  existing solutions in the market by an average of 25% in accuracy and speed
- Establishing a scalable foundation that can grow to support millions of users
  without requiring significant architectural changes
- Building a technical moat that would require competitors substantial resources
  and time to replicate

Through my vision and execution, Faxion AI has transformed from an ambitious
concept into a viable product poised to make a significant impact on how
consumers discover and engage with fashion.

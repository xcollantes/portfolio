## Couch surfing

During the summer after my graduation, I was searching for a job. Instead of
going back home to my parents, I decided I needed to stay active on my own. But
my situation was in a rock and a hard place since I didn't want to return to my
parent's house (even though they invited me to stay) and I needed to actively
look for a career job.

## Surrounded by housing

So I needed a place to stay... then I realized how empty the campus was during
the summer with all the dorms vacant.

Then an idea struck!

I went to the Gonzaga Housing Department which (at the time) was
notorious for having a difficult website to find critical housing information.
Students were required to live on campus for the first two years so every
student at Gonzaga used the Housing website at least once.

**My proposal to a manager of the Housing Department was I redesign the
Department's website in exchange for a dorm room.** The Director of the
Department liked the idea and approved me as a temporary employee with a minimum
wage salary and a rent-free apartment for the summer!

## First consulting gig

The goal was fairly open-ended and straight-forward: Improve the ability of
students to get information from Housing Department.

A metric was needed to measure the project's success so I asked "If the website
isn't helpful, where do students turn for information". So I spoke to the front
desk secretary at the Department with questions like:

- "How many calls do you receive from students each day"
- "What is the top 3 questions you get?"
- "What actions take the most time in your work?"
- "What do you dislike most about your job and what do you wish was better?"

The secretary's answers were a gold mine. She gave me the top pieces of info
students were looking for and the biggest areas of impact my project could make.
After all, when a student is frustrated with the website, naturally they'll call
to talk to a human - I know I did in my time as a student.

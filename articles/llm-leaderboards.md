It is hard to keep up with LLMs because major advancements happen weekly. These
leaderboards help me track the latest models and their performance against each
other.

**NOTE:** LLM advancements are so fast, these leaderboards may not work or are
migrated to another form.

## HuggingFace Performance Leaderboard

Compares pricing, context window, pricing, and response time. This one I have
seen the most commonly referred to.

This leaderboard compares 100+ text and image embedding models across 1000+
languages. Great for finding many human languages.

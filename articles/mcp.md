## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a way for LLMs to interact with external
tools and services. There are times you may want to instruct or ask an LLM like
ChatGPT about something that is not in its training data. MCPs act as a bridge
between the LLM and the external tool or service greatly increasing the
capabilities of the LLM.

  company behind Claude. It is now an open standard and maintained by many LLM
  providers such as Google Deepmind and OpenAI.">

## Why Bother With MCPs?

## Overlapping Capabilities

At this point, you may have thought, _But ChatGPT can reference the internet and
current events, so why do I need MCP?_

## When Not to Use MCP

## MCP Clients

Just like your favorite web browser, there are MCP clients that you can use to
connect to MCP servers.

common MCP clients.

## MCP Servers

If you think of an app or service which you use, there is a good chance that
it has an MCP server and you can offload work to the LLM by connecting your
favorite LLM client to the MCP server.

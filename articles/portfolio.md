Software design lifecycle for my portfolio, xaviercollantes.dev.

https://github.com/xcollantes/portfolio

## Planning

The motivation for creating a portfolio website is driven by the need to show
context of the diversity of interests and technical ability I have accumulated
over the last 8+ years professionally and personally.

### Requirements

- User can find detailed context on a past work or project in
- Modern UX and UI practices

### Goals

Convey depth of ability.

### User journeys

Software engineering managers...

### Initial ideas

TODO: Add Figma designs

TODO: Add screenshots of early designs

Design decisions.

Based on fibonacci spiral.

## Testing strategy

### Speed and tech efficiency

- [Google Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/performance-scoring)
- Chrome Browser DevTools

![TODO: Image of Lighthouse]()

### User satisfaction

1. Gather people I personally know who are in the target demographic and send them
   a link on desktop and mobile. The mix of people should represent technical
   and non-technical since the site content and wording should give both groups
   a sense of impact and depth in the projects. The Senior members of this test
   group should have experience hiring reports.

   - Senior Software Engineer Manager
   - Peer level Software Engineer
   - Non-technical Program Manager
   - Technical recruiter
   - Non-technical recruiter
   - Someone's parent who knows nothing of the tech industry (if this person can
     get a general idea of what Xavier does, then the message is proven to be clear)

1. Ask:
   - How fast did you find detailed information on a project?
   - Is the text easy to read?
   - Are you able to understand in under 30 seconds the article's general gist?
   - If you did not know this person, do you understand his capabilities?
   - How does this profile rank with candidates you have seen in the past?
   - Any other feedback?

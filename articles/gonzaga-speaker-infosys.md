I was lucky enough to be invited to speak at Gonzaga University about my career
experience and provide picture of the current state of the tech industry.

Sharing my experience with students was a great opportunity to give back to the
community and help them understand the current state of the tech industry.

I offer one-on-one help to students on career ideation, resume building, and
interview preparation.

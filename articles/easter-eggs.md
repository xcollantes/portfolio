## Easter eggs

Thank you reading this far. You will now be rewarded with the secrets of my
portfolio.

In classic Googler fashion such as [_do a barrel
role_](https://www.google.com/search?q=do+a+barrel+roll) and [_google in
1998_](https://www.google.com/search?q=google+in+1998), I have created some
easter eggs of my own.

## Conclusion

My personal portfolio reflects a comprehensive software design lifecycle. The
journey involved meticulous planning, user-centric testing, design inspiration,
and technical decision-making. The resulting NextJS portfolio web application
not only serves its purpose but also showcases my commitment to excellence in
software engineering and user-centric design. The inclusion of easter eggs adds
a personal and engaging touch to enhance the overall user experience.

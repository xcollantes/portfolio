## Easter Eggs

Thank you for reading this far. You will now be rewarded with the secrets of my
portfolio.

In classic Googler fashion such as [_do a barrel
roll_](https://www.google.com/search?q=do+a+barrel+roll) and [_google in
1998_](https://www.google.com/search?q=google+in+1998), I have created some
easter eggs of my own.

List of all Google Easter Eggs:

### Cat Facts

1. Long press (hold down) on the name "Xavier Collantes" on the home page.

behavioral insights. Each long press displays a different random fact, so you

## Conclusion

My personal portfolio reflects a comprehensive software design lifecycle. The
journey involved meticulous planning, user-centric testing, design inspiration,
and technical decision-making.

The resulting NextJS portfolio web application not only serves its purpose but
also showcases my commitment to excellence in software engineering and
user-centric design. The inclusion of easter eggs adds a personal and engaging
touch to enhance the overall user experience.

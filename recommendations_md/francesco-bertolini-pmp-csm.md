I have been working with Xavier on-site at Google for more than a year. From the
very first months, he showed initiative and growth-mindset: his technical skills
combined with his amazing communication style helped the team to overcome
obstacles and getting projects done. He developed several automation tools for
optimization of several projects, and that are currently used by several teams
in Google. He will be an extremely valuable resource and asset for current and
future employers.

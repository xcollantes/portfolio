I had the pleasure to work with Xavier using Selenium and Python collaborating for a project on Google. Xavier was a great asset to the project. From helping me on the debugging process and suggesting Selenium features that would make the code faster. He is one of the most enthusiastic people that I worked with, he is always interested in automating and eliminating repetitions on tasks, and he just won't stop researching until achieving the goal.

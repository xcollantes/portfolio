Xavier was one of the most knowledgeable teammate I met so far. He has proven
himself in just as little as 2 months that he's capable of driving team forward.
With his expertise in programming and automation, he wrote several tools to
better support the teams. With his initiative mindset and technical skills, he
implemented and brainstormed validation rules to reduce the overall on-boarding
process.

Xavier exhibits that rare capacity to balance technical passion, knowledge, and
acumen with an appreciation for and ability to communicate with his peers and
managers. In addition, Xavier shows strong understanding of business strategy
and markets, and his perspectives are not limited to technical concepts alone.

With this skill set and strong personal character, I have no doubt that Xavier
will be a great addition to any organization or work group as he wraps his
undergraduate studies and begins his professional pursuits.

The sky is the limit for Xavier individually, and the organization he lands with
will reap great value and reward having him on their team.

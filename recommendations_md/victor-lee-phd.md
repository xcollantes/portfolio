I had the chance to work closely with Xavier during his time at Belva, and he
was a fantastic teammate throughout. We collaborated on a bunch of AI agent
projects—Xavier and I focused on building the agents, as well as integrating
them into the backend. He always moved fast, asked the right questions, and got
things working smoothly.

What stood out to me most was how quickly he could take a rough idea and turn it
into something solid and deployable. He didn't need a lot of hand-holding—just
dove in, figured things out, and delivered. He really understood how all the
pieces fit together and made sure everything worked well in production.

Over time, we shipped more than 20 AI agents together, and the process was
always smooth thanks to his attention to detail and sense of ownership. He's
sharp, easy to work with, and always willing to learn and share ideas. I'd
happily work with him again, and I’d definitely recommend him to any team
building AI or backend systems.

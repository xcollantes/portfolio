Xavier proved to be a very effective member of the team, taking a major initiative from scratch to production. His blend of soft skills (thanks for all the laughs) and engineering capabilities enables him to test out new ideas and get them implemented quickly. Even more than that, he is the kind of person with a deep understanding of the data and an attitude to get things done here at Google in the best possible way. I would definitely welcome any opportunity to work with him again.

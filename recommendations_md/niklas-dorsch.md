I've had the pleasure of working closely with Xavier on the SLS team at Google
for the past four years. Xavier excels at end-to-end project management,
consistently researching, planning, and executing tasks with a strong focus on
user experience and business objectives. His technical expertise, particularly
in implementing monitoring systems for our key products, has been instrumental
in achieving reliability goals. Xavier is a skilled problem-solver with a proven
ability to bridge technical and collaborative aspects of a project. I highly
recommend him for roles that demand these qualities.

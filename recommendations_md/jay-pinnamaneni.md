I've had the pleasure of working with Xavier on several initiatives over the
last few years. Across these efforts, Xavier's strong technical competencies in
sql, javascript, python and data pipeline design enabled our team to prototype
new solutions and roll out changes. In addition to these skills, Xavier's
ability to document development efforts and tacit knowledge has helped decrease
the ramp-up time for new team members and customers. I would highly recommend
Xavier for any software solutions and management roles!

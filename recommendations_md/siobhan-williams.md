I worked with Xavier for the last 3 months of his tenure at Google, where he
will be sorely missed. Xavier is a highly skilled and adaptable professional
with a strong blend of technical and project management skills. He is
capable of independently building effective solutions using only broad
descriptions of a problem statement. His project management prowess,
understanding of requirements, and ability to craft effective solutions are
invaluable. Xavier's problem-solving mindset, cross-functional collaboration
skills, and technical expertise would make him a valuable asset to any team
seeking a driven individual for technical initiatives.

Here's an example of Xavier's excellence...

I unwittingly came across Xavier's work by utilizing a tool he was
responsible for building. Although this tool was originally designed for a
different purpose, it was more intuitive and better than the stock version
available. My team needed a highly operable solution that could scale
globally, so I considered extending Xavier's tool. I sent a message to the
Googleverse in an attempt to build a relationship with a project owner,
whoever that might be. Using only an email with the technical requirements
of a scaled solution, Xavier was able to deliver a highly performant and
critical solution that enabled our team to monitor real-time global outages
with ease. Within 2 days, we had a working prototype that was effective
immediately. I was expecting an olive branch for future discussions but got
a working prototype instead.

Xavier's original design was so well implemented, it scaled up (or down)
seamlessly. That's impressive, but his willingness to unquestionably jump in
and support another team as we work toward the company's mission is what
makes him a great teammate.

Large organizations are often burdened with the red tape of allocation
conversations, alignment meetings, and triple confirmations. Xavier is able
to move at the speed of a startup to deliver high-quality solutions in any
organizational structure.

Xavier's excitement, passion, and dedication for music has helped him grow into
an outstanding performer throughout his years at Gonzaga University. His ability
to consistently be prepared goes beyond the classroom as it demonstrates
Xavier's demand for excellence from himself in all aspects of life.

In addition, his happy and cheerful demeanor has allowed him to fulfill any role
within a team and has set him apart as a natural leader capable of positively
connecting with those around him.

I fully anticipate Xavier to be a fantastic addition to the business world!

Had the privilege to work with Xavier on a high impact, high velocity project at
Google and was the first hand witness to the high quality professionalism and
technical skillsets he brought to the table.

Xavier has a strong technical
problem solving acumen and is very proactive in assessing workflow efficiency
improvement opportunities leveraging automations and LLM solutions. I would
highly recommend him for TPgM roles and would love to have an opportunity to
collaborate with him again.

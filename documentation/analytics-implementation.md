# Google Analytics Implementation Guide

This document outlines the Google Analytics implementation in the portfolio website to track user visits, page views, and engagement metrics.

## üö® TROUBLESHOOTING CHECKLIST

If you're not seeing data in GA4, follow this checklist:

### 1. Quick Verification (2 minutes)
- [ ] Visit `/analytics-test` page in development
- [ ] Open browser DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
- [ ] Click test buttons and look for requests to `google-analytics.com/g/collect`
- [ ] Check GA4 Real-time reports while testing

### 2. Common Issues & Solutions
- **No real-time data**: Wait 5-10 minutes, GA4 can be delayed
- **No historical data**: GA4 takes 24-48 hours to populate reports
- **Development vs Production**: Ensure GA tracking works on both
- **Ad blockers**: Test with ad blockers disabled
- **Console errors**: Check browser console for GA-related errors

### 3. Debug Mode (Development Only)
- GA Debugger appears in bottom-right corner in dev mode
- Console logs show all GA events with `üîç GA4 Event:` prefix
- Debug mode is automatically enabled in development environment

## Implementation Overview

Google Analytics 4 is implemented using the `@next/third-parties/google` library, which provides optimized components for Google Analytics integration.

### Core Setup

The Google Analytics tracking code is initialized in `_app.tsx` with enhanced configuration:

```tsx
<GoogleAnalytics 
  gaId="G-HB7D403D67" 
  dataLayerName="dataLayer"
/>

{/* Enhanced GA4 Configuration */}
<script dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
  __html: `
    window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
    function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
    
    gtag('config', 'G-HB7D403D67', {
      page_title: document.title,
      page_location: window.location.href,
      debug_mode: ${process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'},
      send_page_view: true,
      enhanced_measurement: true,
      allow_ad_personalization_signals: false,
      anonymize_ip: true
    });
  `
}} />
```

## Tracked Metrics

The following metrics are tracked across the website:

### 1. Page Views

- **What**: Records when a user visits any page
- **When**: On initial page load and subsequent route changes
- **Implementation**:
  - Uses the router's `routeChangeComplete` event in `_app.tsx`
  - Sends page path, title, and full URL

### 2. Page Time Spent

- **What**: Records how long a user spends on each page
- **When**: When navigating away from a page or closing the site
- **Implementation**:
  - Measures time between page load and navigation/exit
  - Uses `trackTimeOnPage` utility in `AnalyticsUtils.ts`

### 3. Article Engagement

- **What**: Tracks how users interact with article content
- **When**: During article viewing
- **Implementation**:
  - `ArticleAnalytics.tsx` component added to article pages
  - Tracks initial view, scroll depth, and total reading time

### 4. Navigation Patterns

- **What**: Records how users navigate between pages
- **When**: On page transitions
- **Implementation**:
  - Captures source and destination pages using `trackNavigation`

### 5. Recommendation Interactions

- **What**: Tracks interaction with recommendation entries
- **When**: When expanding/collapsing recommendations or sharing links
- **Implementation**:
  - In `recs.tsx`, records actions like expand, collapse, and share
  - Captures which recommendations are most viewed

## Analytics Utility Functions

Custom utility functions are available in `components/AnalyticsUtils.ts`:

- `trackPageView`: Records page views
- `trackUserInteraction`: Records user interactions with UI elements
- `trackNavigation`: Records navigation between pages
- `trackTimeOnPage`: Records time spent on pages

## Sending Custom Events

To track additional interactions, use the utility functions:

```tsx
// Import the utility
import { trackUserInteraction } from "../components/AnalyticsUtils"

// Track an interaction
trackUserInteraction("button_click", "download_resume", "button")
```

## Viewing Analytics Data

Access your Google Analytics data:

1. Go to the [Google Analytics dashboard](https://analytics.google.com/)
2. Navigate to "Reports" in the sidebar
3. View default reports or create custom ones for specific metrics

## Event Types Reference

### Standard GA4 Events (Recommended)

- `page_view`: Page visits with enhanced parameters
- `user_engagement`: Time on page, engagement metrics
- `select_content`: UI element interactions  
- `view_item`: Article and content views

### Event Parameters

All events now use GA4-compatible parameters:
- `content_type`: Type of content (article, page, etc.)
- `content_id`: Unique identifier
- `engagement_time_msec`: Time in milliseconds
- `page_path`: Current page path
- `scroll_depth`: Percentage scrolled

### Debug Events (Development Only)

- Console logging enabled with `üîç GA4 Event:` prefix
- GA Debugger component for real-time testing
- Network request monitoring in DevTools

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas to expand analytics coverage:

1. Track external link clicks
2. Track file downloads
3. Add conversion tracking for key actions
4. Implement enhanced e-commerce tracking if applicable

## Maintenance

### When adding new pages or features:

1. Consider what user interactions should be tracked
2. Use the appropriate utility functions to track them
3. Follow established patterns for consistency
4. Test events using the GA Debugger in development

### After GA4 is confirmed working:

1. **Remove test files**: Delete `/pages/analytics-test.tsx`
2. **Remove debugger**: Remove GADebugger import from `_app.tsx`
3. **Production testing**: Verify analytics work on live site
4. **Set up alerts**: Configure GA4 alerts for data anomalies

### Regular Checks:

- Monthly: Review GA4 data quality and completeness
- Quarterly: Audit tracked events for relevance
- After deployments: Verify analytics still work correctly

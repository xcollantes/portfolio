/**
 * Article Exception Configuration System
 *
 * This file manages articles that are exceptions to the normal access control rules.
 * By default, all articles require human verification and are not indexed by search engines.
 * This system allows specific articles to bypass these restrictions.
 *
 * EXCEPTION CRITERIA:
 * Only add articles here that meet ALL of the following criteria:
 * 1. Content is suitable for public consumption (no sensitive information)
 * 2. Content adds value for public discovery (educational, portfolio, etc.)
 * 3. Content represents professional work or educational material
 * 4. Content does not contain personal or private information
 *
 * WHEN TO ADD EXCEPTIONS:
 * ✅ Portfolio pieces showcasing professional work
 * ✅ Educational tutorials and technical guides
 * ✅ Public-facing work experiences and achievements
 * ✅ Blog posts intended for broader audience reach
 *
 * WHEN NOT TO ADD EXCEPTIONS:
 * ❌ Personal stories or experiences
 * ❌ Content with sensitive company information
 * ❌ Experimental or draft content
 * ❌ Content meant only for specific individuals
 *
 * SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
 * - Exceptions bypass all access controls - content becomes fully public
 * - Search engines will index and cache the content permanently
 * - Content will appear in search results and social media previews
 * - Consider data privacy implications before adding exceptions
 *
 * PROCESS FOR ADDING EXCEPTIONS:
 * 1. Ensure article meets all exception criteria above
 * 2. Add entry to articleExceptions object with clear reason
 * 3. Set both bypassVerification and allowSearchIndexing appropriately
 * 4. Test the article accessibility in development
 * 5. Monitor search engine indexing after deployment

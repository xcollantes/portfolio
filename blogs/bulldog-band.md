## Bulldog Band: The Ultimate Experience

Imagine for one month every year in college you had an all-expenses paid trip
including food, hotels, and a chartered flight with your closest friends to a
handful of cities across the United States including Las Vegas, San Jose,
Chicago, and Phoenix to name a few. For every city you stay, you'll have a meal
stipend and plenty of time to tour the sights.

On top of that, you have free court-side seats to the most anticipated
basketball games during the NCAA March Madness. In the Final Four, [Row D seats

$50,000](https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/final-four-2017-heres-what-tickets-are-selling-for-one-package-almost-50k)
let alone seats court-side.

_What does one have to do for all this?_ Show up with an instrument and be
prepared to cheer and dance around.

For my entire time at Gonzaga University, I was an active leader in the Gonzaga
Bulldog Band.

As time went on and built the trust and friendship of many of my fellow band
members, I eventually became the "Fungineer" or "Fun Engineer", a non-official
position in the Bulldog Band leadership who was in charge of leading cheers and
morale boosting morale of the ~80 members in the band.

The role required certain traits (as I soon learned) to be successful:
creativity and listening.

Creativity is a main tool of the Fungineer. Rallying a platoon of college
students to cheer the same way or get every single band member to participate is
a massive challenge is any endeavor. The little dances the band does or the
sheer amount of noise it can generate depends on how much enthusiasm a person is
inspired with to set the fire which burns throughout the crowd. Perhaps the
arena is quiet or the opposing team is about to make a free-throw shot and the
player is facing the band, that's the time for a cheer.

As in musicianship, listening is key to understanding how a person can
contribute to a situation. "Where is the beat?", "whose solo is next?", "does
this drum fill belong here?", same with playing music in a group or duet, a
leader must be attuned to the temperature of the team and how the people in the
team feel and reconciling the team's emotional temperature with desired feeling
you want to convey or steer the group into.

Imagine the last home game in before the tournament, the whole arena is glum,
[Zags down 11-25](https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/game/_/gameId/400915890) during senior night. Of course
as part of that crowd, the band will share the feeling, but it's the job of the
Fungineer to repel such forces of sorrow. But how do you do that with a full
band at 80 members in a
sold out game of 6,000 alumni, students, and local Spokanites? You're only 1% of
the whole crowd after all. You are the Fungineer, you envision not what is but
what could be; and you do this by being the spark in a tinderbox of 6,000
Gonzaga fans.

You stand up in front of the band and do one simple thing: you get on a seat
facing the band and wait... Until every pair of eyes are locked at you curiously...
Point at the edges of the band 20 rows up, making eye direct contact with
every human in a band uniform... Take a deep breath and from the bottom of
your lungs, you yell in a deep pitch. "HOOOOO!" And as you yell as deep as your
body can take, motion your arms up and down. The band starts yelling back in a
raucous rallying response... They starts jumping
up and down... The band faces the crowd and transfers their war yell across the
arena... You see the crowd of 6,000 stand up and the noise in the area reaches a
fever pitch.

Congratulations, you are a Fungineer. Like the drovers of the old Wild
American West, herding cattle across miles and reining strays; you are a
wrangler of fervent college students directing the masses to exert their
potential together.

## Bulldog Band: The Ultimate Experience

Imagine for one month every year in college you had an all-expenses paid trip
including food, hotels, and a chartered flight with your closest friends to a
handful of cities across the United States including Las Vegas, San Jose,
Chicago, and Phoenix to name a few. For every city you stay, you'll have a meal
stipend and plenty of time to tour the sights.

On top of that, you have free court-side seats to the most anticipated
basketball games during the NCAA March Madness. In the Final Four, [Row D seats
alone costs
$50,000](https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/final-four-2017-heres-what-tickets-are-selling-for-one-package-almost-50k)
let alone seats court-side.

_What does one have to do for all this?_ Show up with an instrument and be
prepared to cheer and dance around.

For my entire time at Gonzaga University, I was an active leader in the Gonzaga
Bulldog Band.

As time went on and built the trust and friendship of many of my fellow band
members, I eventually became the "Fungineer" or "Fun Engineer", a non-official
position in the Bulldog Band leadership who was in charge of leading cheers and
morale boosting the ~80 members in the band.

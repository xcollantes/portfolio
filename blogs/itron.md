Liberty Lake, WA in 2015, I had the opportunity to be an intern at Itron, Inc.,
a technology company for utility meters, smart meters, and data management of
utilities.

##

## Challenges

## Overcoming the challenges

## Lessons learned

### Organize

### Include stakeholders early

Another lesson I learned was to identify and include the stakeholders early. I
made the mistake of thinking of a solution before including the most important
ingredient: the end user. In this case the end user was the person working in
finance.

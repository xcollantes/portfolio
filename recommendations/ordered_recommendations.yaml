    so well implemented, it scaled up (or down) seamlessly. That's impressive...
  fullRec: >
    I worked with Xavier for the last 3 months of his tenure at Google, where he
    will be sorely missed. Xavier is a highly skilled and adaptable professional
    with a strong blend of technical and project management skills. He is
    capable of independently building effective solutions using only broad
    descriptions of a problem statement. His project management prowess,
    understanding of requirements, and ability to craft effective solutions are
    invaluable. Xavier's problem-solving mindset, cross-functional collaboration
    skills, and technical expertise would make him a valuable asset to any team
    seeking a driven individual for technical initiatives.

    Here's an example of Xavier's excellence...

    I unwittingly came across Xavier's work by utilizing a tool he was
    responsible for building. Although this tool was originally designed for a
    different purpose, it was more intuitive and better than the stock version
    available. My team needed a highly operable solution that could scale
    globally, so I considered extending Xavier's tool. I sent a message to the
    Googleverse in an attempt to build a relationship with a project owner,
    whoever that might be. Using only an email with the technical requirements
    of a scaled solution, Xavier was able to deliver a highly performant and
    critical solution that enabled our team to monitor real-time global outages
    with ease. Within 2 days, we had a working prototype that was effective
    immediately. I was expecting an olive branch for future discussions but got
    a working prototype instead.

    Xavier's original design was so well implemented, it scaled up (or down)
    seamlessly. That's impressive, but his willingness to unquestionably jump in
    and support another team as we work toward the company's mission is what
    makes him a great teammate.

    Large organizations are often burdened with the red tape of allocation
    conversations, alignment meetings, and triple confirmations. Xavier is able
    to move at the speed of a startup to deliver high-quality solutions in any
    organizational structure.

    Xavier exhibits that rare capacity to balance technical passion, knowledge,
    and acumen with an appreciation for and ability to communicate with his

    wraps his undergraduate studies and begins his professional pursuits.

    The sky is the limit for Xavier individually, and the organization he lands
    with will reap great value and reward having him on their team.
